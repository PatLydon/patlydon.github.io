              <p>
                Cryptocurrencies are stored in Wallets or digital wallets that can work with the software or application
                format. These
                spaces provide the user with a password that grants him the right to operate with the assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Transactions are carried out between wallets using public codes (keys) that are responsible for transferring
                cryptocurrencies from one wallet to another. Subsequently, these movements are registered in the public
                ledger or chain
                of blocks (Blockchain).

                Any user who has the same cryptocurrency, can enter the system and view the figures of the operations but
                not the
                information of the users. It is important to know that once the transaction is executed it is impossible to
                reverse it.
